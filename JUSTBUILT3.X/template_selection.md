# Template Selection for Just Built IDE

## Requirements Analysis

After analyzing the requirements for the "Just Built" IDE, it's clear that this application has both significant frontend and backend needs:

### Frontend Requirements
- Complex, interactive UI with split panels for code editing, plan display, and controls
- Real-time updates and rendering of code
- Support for file uploads/downloads
- GitHub integration interface
- LLM selection and configuration interface

### Backend Requirements
- Integration with multiple LLM APIs (Gemini, Mistral, Groq)
- Local model support via OLLAMA
- File storage and management
- GitHub API integration
- Build pipeline for various deployment targets

## Template Decision

Based on these requirements, **a combination of React frontend with Flask backend** is the most appropriate approach:

### React Frontend Justification
- React is ideal for building complex, interactive UIs with multiple components
- The application requires real-time updates and state management across different panels
- React's component-based architecture will help organize the various UI elements (code editor, plan display, LLM selection, etc.)
- The pre-installed React template includes Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, which will accelerate UI development

### Flask Backend Justification
- The application requires server-side processing for LLM API calls
- File management and storage needs server-side handling
- GitHub API integration is better handled server-side for security
- The build pipeline for deployment options requires server-side processing
- Flask's flexibility makes it suitable for integrating with various external services

## Implementation Plan

1. Use the pre-installed `create_react_app` command for the frontend
2. Use the pre-installed `create_flask_app` command for the backend
3. Structure the application with:
   - React frontend handling UI and user interactions
   - Flask backend handling LLM API calls, file management, and GitHub integration
   - RESTful API communication between frontend and backend

This hybrid approach will provide the best balance of interactive frontend capabilities and robust backend services needed for the Just Built IDE.
