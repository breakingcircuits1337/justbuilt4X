# Just Built IDE - UI Design and User Flow

## Overall Interface Design

The Just Built IDE interface is designed as a modern, intuitive web application that balances power and usability. The interface adopts a responsive design approach that works across different screen sizes while maintaining optimal functionality on desktop environments where development work typically occurs. The color scheme follows a professional dark theme with accent colors to highlight important actions and status indicators, reducing eye strain during extended coding sessions.

The main interface is structured as a flexible, multi-panel layout that users can customize to their workflow preferences. The primary organization divides the screen into several key regions that work together to provide a seamless development experience. The layout maintains a clean visual hierarchy that guides users through the natural workflow from project specification to completed application.

## Main Layout Components

The main window is divided into several primary regions that work together cohesively. At the top of the interface sits a persistent navigation bar containing the Just Built logo, project title, main menu access, and global actions such as settings, user profile, and help. This bar remains visible at all times, providing consistent access to top-level navigation.

Below the navigation bar, the interface splits into a flexible panel system. The default configuration presents three main panels arranged horizontally: a narrow left sidebar for project navigation and tools, a wide central workspace that contains the code editor and preview areas, and a right panel for plan management and LLM configuration. Users can resize these panels by dragging the dividers between them, collapse panels temporarily, or even reconfigure the layout to stack panels vertically if preferred.

The left sidebar contains a hierarchical project explorer showing files and folders, quick access buttons for common tools, and a collapsible section for GitHub integration. This sidebar serves as the primary navigation hub for project resources and tools. The central workspace occupies the majority of the screen real estate, containing a sophisticated code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and code folding capabilities. Above the editor, tabs allow quick switching between open files. The right panel houses the step-by-step plan editor, LLM configuration options, and build controls.

At the bottom of the interface, a status bar provides system feedback, build progress indicators, and access to the console output and logs. This area expands when needed to show more detailed information without disrupting the main workspace.

## User Flow

The user experience follows a logical progression from project conception to completed application. When first accessing the Just Built IDE, users are presented with a welcoming dashboard showing recent projects, templates, and quick-start options. From here, they can either open an existing project or start a new one.

When creating a new project, users enter a natural language description of what they want to build in a prominent text area. This description serves as the foundation for the entire development process. After submitting their description, the system enters the research and planning phase, during which the selected LLM researches relevant information and generates a step-by-step development plan.

Once the plan is generated, it appears in the right panel as an interactive, editable list of steps. Each step includes a title, description, and estimated completion time. Users can review this plan, reorder steps via drag-and-drop, edit existing steps by clicking on them, or add new steps through an intuitive interface. This plan becomes the roadmap for the entire development process.

After finalizing the plan, users can choose their preferred execution mode. The "Auto Run" button at the top of the plan panel initiates automatic execution of all steps in sequence. Alternatively, users can select individual steps and execute them manually using the "Run Step" button that appears next to each step. During execution, the system provides visual feedback by highlighting the current step and showing progress indicators.

As steps are executed, the code editor in the central panel updates in real-time, showing the code being generated. Users can intervene at any point by clicking in the editor to make manual adjustments. The system intelligently handles these interventions, incorporating user changes into subsequent automated steps.

Throughout the development process, users have access to the LLM configuration panel, where they can select which model to use or activate the mixture mode to combine multiple models. This panel includes detailed options for each model, including version selection, temperature settings, and specialized configurations for the cybersecurity agent.

File management operations are accessible through both the left sidebar and a dedicated menu in the top navigation bar. Users can upload existing files, download the current project, import external resources, or export specific components. GitHub integration is available through a specialized panel that appears when the GitHub option is selected from the sidebar, allowing repository operations without leaving the IDE.

When the application is ready for deployment, users access the build options through a dedicated build panel. This interface provides clear choices for local deployment, web deployment, or hybrid options, with appropriate configuration settings for each target environment.

## Key Interface Components

### Project Input and Planning Area

The project input area appears prominently when starting a new project. It features a large text field with supportive placeholder text guiding users to describe their desired application in detail. Below this field, quick-access buttons for common project types provide templates and starting points. After submission, this area transforms into the research display, showing relevant information the LLM has gathered to inform the development process.

The planning interface presents the generated steps in a clear, hierarchical view. Each step is represented as a card containing a numbered title, detailed description, and action buttons. Steps can be expanded to show substeps or additional details. Color coding indicates step status: pending steps appear in neutral colors, the current step is highlighted, completed steps show a success indicator, and any steps with issues are flagged for attention.

### Code Editor

The code editor forms the heart of the IDE, occupying the central workspace. It features professional coding capabilities including syntax highlighting for multiple languages, line numbers, code folding, and intelligent indentation. The editor supports multiple open files through a tabbed interface at the top, with each tab showing the filename and language icon.

Above the editor, a toolbar provides common editing functions and view options. The editor itself renders code with a monospaced font optimized for readability, with careful attention to contrast and spacing. When the LLM is actively generating code, new content appears with subtle highlighting that fades after a moment, making it easy to track changes.

A minimap on the right edge of the editor provides a zoomed-out overview of the entire file, with the current viewport highlighted. At the bottom of the editor, status information shows the current line and column position, file size, and encoding.

### LLM Selection and Configuration

The LLM configuration panel presents available models in a visually distinct manner, with logos or icons representing each provider (Gemini, Mistral, Groq, and OLLAMA). Users select their preferred model by clicking on these visual elements, which then expand to show detailed configuration options specific to that model.

For the mixture mode, a specialized interface allows users to select multiple models by checking boxes next to each option. When mixture mode is active, a visual representation shows how the models will collaborate, with options to adjust the contribution weight of each model.

The cybersecurity agent option appears with appropriate visual indicators distinguishing it from standard configurations, including clear labeling about its ethical use for defensive security purposes. When selected, this option reveals additional configuration fields specific to security applications.

### File Management and GitHub Integration

File operations are accessible through an intuitive file explorer in the left sidebar, displaying the project structure as a hierarchical tree. Context menus provide quick access to common operations like rename, delete, and create new files or folders. Drag-and-drop functionality allows for easy reorganization of the project structure.

Upload and download functions appear as prominent buttons in the file explorer header, opening modal dialogs when selected. The import/export functionality is accessible through the main menu, with clear options for different formats and targets.

The GitHub integration panel provides a streamlined interface for repository operations. Users can connect to their GitHub account, create new repositories, clone existing ones, and perform common Git operations like commit, push, and pull. A simplified visualization shows the current branch and commit history.

### Build and Deployment Options

The build interface presents deployment options as visual cards, each representing a different target environment (local, web, or hybrid). Selecting an option reveals a configuration form with appropriate settings for that environment. Build progress is displayed through a progress bar and detailed log output.

For local builds, options include platform selection (Windows, macOS, Linux) and packaging preferences. Web deployment options include server configuration, domain settings, and optimization levels. The hybrid option combines these settings into a unified interface.

## Responsive Behavior

While optimized for desktop use, the Just Built IDE adapts intelligently to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, panels automatically collapse into a tabbed interface, allowing users to focus on one aspect of development at a time. Touch targets increase in size on touch-enabled devices, and gesture support enables common operations like pinch-to-zoom in the code editor.

On mobile devices, the interface reorganizes into a vertical stack, with expandable sections for each major component. While the full development experience is designed for larger screens, the mobile view provides adequate functionality for reviewing projects, making minor edits, and monitoring build progress while away from a desktop environment.

## Accessibility Considerations

The interface implements comprehensive accessibility features, including proper semantic HTML structure, ARIA labels for interactive elements, keyboard navigation support, and sufficient color contrast. All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard shortcuts, with a visible focus indicator showing the current selection.

A high-contrast mode is available through the settings menu, adjusting colors for users with visual impairments. Font sizes can be adjusted globally, and the interface respects the user's system preferences for reduced motion and other accessibility settings.

## Visual Feedback and System Status

Throughout the interface, thoughtful visual feedback keeps users informed about system status. Operations in progress display appropriate loading indicators, with estimated completion times for longer processes. Success and error states are clearly indicated through both color and iconography, with detailed messages available when needed.

The LLM's "rest" state is visualized through a subtle indicator in the status bar, showing when the model is active, resting, or transitioning between states. This indicator includes a tooltip with detailed information about the model's current context retention and performance optimization status.

## Conclusion

The Just Built IDE interface design creates a powerful yet approachable development environment that guides users through the process of creating applications with AI assistance. By combining intuitive visual design with thoughtful user flows, the interface makes complex operations accessible while maintaining the depth and flexibility needed for professional development work. The design prioritizes clarity and efficiency, helping users harness the power of multiple LLMs to build applications quickly and effectively.
